# CALF

*Work In Progress*

CALF is a dependant programming language designed to be embedded into Rust programs. It transcompiles into Rust code.

The language name stands for _**CAL**culator with **F**unctions_.

It is pure functional, single-typed, and oriented to parallel vector processing. Influenced by:

- Futhark: functional, vector processing, parallelism.
- Rust: closures syntax.
- Python: single expression lambdas.
- Lisp: list as the basic data type.
- C: ternary operator.
- Ante: vector indexing syntax.
- Lua: grammar without end of statement marker.
